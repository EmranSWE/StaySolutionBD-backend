### Development Workflow

- **Version Control**: We use Git for version control, hosted on [GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket]. All new features are developed on separate branches and merged into the main branch via pull requests.
- **Code Reviews**: Each pull request is reviewed by at least one other team member to ensure code quality, adherence to our coding standards, and to catch potential issues early.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: We employ CI tools to automate testing and build processes, ensuring that all merges into the main branch are tested.
- **Coding Standards**: Our codebase adheres to a set of coding standards for consistency and readability. We follow [Airbnb/Google/Standard] style guides for [JavaScript/TypeScript].
- **Documentation**: All functions and modules are documented in the code, and we maintain an updated README and a detailed API documentation for developers.
### Monitoring and Logging

- **Monitoring**: We monitor our application using tools like [New Relic/DataDog/Sentry] to track performance metrics and uptime.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging is in place for error tracking and to provide insights into the application's behavior in real-time.

This diligent approach to development and testing ensures that StaySolutionBD remains reliable, secure, and easy to maintain, all while continuously evolving to meet the needs of our users.


## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Our database schema is designed to optimize for efficiency and scalability, ensuring that StaySolutionBD can handle a growing number of users and an increasing volume of data. The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a crucial part of our documentation, providing a clear visual representation of the data model and the relationships between the different entities.

### Overview of the ERD

![StaySolutionBD Banner](StaySolutionsBD-ERD.png)

- **Users**: Central to our platform, containing details about renters and property owners.
- **Properties**: Listed by owners, containing details like location, amenities, and availability.
- **Bookings**: Connecting users to properties, with details about rental periods and statuses.
- **Payments**: Tracking financial transactions related to property bookings.
- **MonthlyRentPayments**: Specific entity for handling recurring rent payments.
- ... (and other entities like Reviews, Issues, Messages, Notifications, Wishlist, etc.)

### Relationships

- **One-to-Many**: For example, a single user can have multiple bookings, but each booking is associated with one user.
- **Many-to-Many**: For instance, users can have many properties on their wishlist, and each property can be on the wishlist of many users.
- **One-to-One**: Such as a property having one safety record.

### Navigating the ERD

Our ERD includes:

- **Tables**: Each table represents an entity in our database, such as `Users`, `Properties`, or `Bookings`.
- **Columns**: Attributes within the tables, such as `UserID`, `PropertyID`, etc.
- **Primary Keys (PK)**: Uniquely identifies each record within a table.
- **Foreign Keys (FK)**: Establishes a link between the data in two tables.
- **Relationship Lines**: Illustrate how tables are related, including cardinality and optionality of the relationships.
